        <h2>6. Intellectual Property</h2>
        <p>
          The Service and its original content (excluding open-source

          intellectual property laws. Your data remains your property.
        </p>

        <h2>7. Service Availability</h2>
        <p>
          We strive to maintain high availability but do not guarantee
          uninterrupted access. We may modify, suspend, or discontinue any part
          of the Service with reasonable notice. Scheduled maintenance windows
          will be communicated in advance.
        </p>

        <h2>8. Limitation of Liability</h2>

          To the maximum extent permitted by law, Vex shall not be liable for
          any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages,
          including loss of profits, data, or business opportunities, arising
          from your use of the Service.
        </p>

        <h2>9. Indemnification</h2>

        <h2>10. Termination</h2>
        <p>
          We may terminate or suspend your access immediately, without prior
          notice, for conduct that we believe violates these Terms or is harmful
          to other users or the Service. Upon termination, your right to use the
          Service ceases immediately.
        </p>

        <h2>11. Changes to Terms</h2>

          We reserve the right to modify these Terms at any time. Material
          changes will be communicated via email or a notice on the Service.
          Continued use after changes constitutes acceptance.
