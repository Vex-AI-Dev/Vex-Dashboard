# Vex

> Runtime reliability for AI agents in production.

Vex is an open-source runtime reliability layer that detects when AI agent behavior
silently drifts in production. It observes every LLM call, corrects hallucinations
and policy violations in real time, and continuously optimizes agent performance.

## Key Features
- Real-time observability for every agent action
- Automatic correction of hallucinations, drift, and policy violations
- Continuous optimization of prompts, thresholds, and correction strategies
- Works with LangChain, CrewAI, OpenAI Assistants, and any Python/TypeScript agent
