<Steps>

<Step title="Install the SDK">

<CodeGroup>

```bash Python
pip install vex-sdk
```

```bash TypeScript
npm install @vex_dev/sdk
```

</CodeGroup>

</Step>

<Step title="Add your API key">

Get your API key from the [Vex dashboard](https://app.tryvex.dev). Navigate to **Settings → API Keys** and create a new key.

Set it as an environment variable so you never hard-code credentials in source:

<CodeGroup>

```bash bash
export VEX_API_KEY=your-api-key
```

</CodeGroup>

Both SDKs automatically read `VEX_API_KEY` from the environment. You can also pass the key explicitly via the `api_key` constructor argument (Python) or `apiKey` option (TypeScript) — useful for environments where environment variables are managed through a secrets manager.

</Step>

<Step title="Add tracing to your agent">

Wrap your agent function with a single call. Vex records inputs, outputs, and intermediate steps, then returns a `VexResult` with the original output and a verification verdict.

<CodeGroup>

```python Python
from vex import Vex

guard = Vex(api_key="your-api-key")

@guard.watch(agent_id="support-bot", task="Answer customer questions")
def handle_support(query: str) -> str:
    return my_agent.run(query)

result = handle_support("How do I reset my password?")
print(result.output)     # The agent's response
print(result.action)     # "pass", "flag", or "block"
```

```typescript TypeScript
import { Vex } from '@vex_dev/sdk';

const vex = new Vex({ apiKey: 'your-api-key' });

const result = await vex.trace(
  { agentId: 'support-bot', task: 'Answer customer questions' },
  async (ctx) => {
    const response = await myAgent.run('How do I reset my password?');
    ctx.record(response);
  }
);

console.log(result.output);     // The agent's response
console.log(result.action);     // "pass", "flag", or "block"
```

</CodeGroup>

<Note>
The `action` field tells you what Vex decided: `"pass"` means the output met your quality threshold, `"flag"` means it was marginal and logged for review, and `"block"` means it was below threshold and (if correction is enabled) a corrected output was returned instead.
</Note>

</Step>

<Step title="See results in the dashboard">

Open [app.tryvex.dev](https://app.tryvex.dev) and navigate to **Traces**. Every call to `guard.watch` or `vex.trace` appears here with:

- The full input and output recorded for the execution
- Confidence score and the action taken (pass / flag / block)
- Breakdown of each verification check (schema, hallucination, task drift, coherence)
- Latency and token usage per step
- Any corrections that were applied, and which correction layer was triggered

Flagged traces are surfaced in the **Review** queue so your team can inspect and annotate them without writing any additional tooling.
