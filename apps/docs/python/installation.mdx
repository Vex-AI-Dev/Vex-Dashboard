## Requirements

The Vex Python SDK requires **Python 3.9 or later**. The following packages are installed automatically as dependencies — you do not need to install them separately:

- [`httpx`](https://www.python-httpx.org/) — async-capable HTTP client used for all API communication
- [`pydantic`](https://docs.pydantic.dev/) v2 — used for config validation and result modeling

## Install the package

```bash
pip install vex-sdk
```

If you manage dependencies with a lockfile, pin to a minor version to avoid unexpected breaking changes:

```bash
pip install "vex-sdk>=0.3,<0.4"
```

## Initialize the client

There are two ways to pass your API key to the `Vex` constructor.

<CodeGroup>

```python Environment variable (recommended)
import os
from vex import Vex

# SDK reads VEX_API_KEY automatically when api_key is omitted.
# Set the variable before starting your process:
#   export VEX_API_KEY=vex_live_...
guard = Vex(api_key=os.environ["VEX_API_KEY"])
```

```python Explicit argument
from vex import Vex

guard = Vex(api_key="vex_live_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx")
```

</CodeGroup>

<Tip>
Always load the API key from an environment variable or secrets manager in production. Never commit a raw key to source control.
</Tip>

### API key validation rules

The constructor raises `ConfigurationError` immediately if the key is invalid — before any network call is made.

| Rule | Detail |
|---|---|
| Must not be empty | An empty string raises `ConfigurationError` |
| Minimum length | At least 10 characters |

```python
from vex import Vex, ConfigurationError

try:
    guard = Vex(api_key="short")
except ConfigurationError as e:
    print(f"Bad key: {e}")
```

## Passing a custom configuration

Pass a `VexConfig` instance as the second argument to override any defaults:

```python
from vex import Vex, VexConfig

guard = Vex(
    api_key=os.environ["VEX_API_KEY"],
    config=VexConfig(
        mode="sync",
        correction="cascade",
    ),
)
```

See [Configuration](/python/configuration) for the full parameter reference.

## Cleanup

The SDK starts a background flush thread on initialization. Call `guard.close()` when your process is shutting down to flush any buffered events and stop the thread cleanly.

```python
import atexit
from vex import Vex

guard = Vex(api_key=os.environ["VEX_API_KEY"])

# Register once at startup — runs automatically on interpreter exit.
atexit.register(guard.close)
```

`guard.close()` is idempotent and safe to call multiple times. In long-running services you can also call it explicitly in a shutdown signal handler.

<Note>
Skipping `guard.close()` at process exit will not cause data loss in most cases — the OS will flush open sockets — but calling it explicitly guarantees that the final batch of events is delivered before the process terminates.
</Note>
