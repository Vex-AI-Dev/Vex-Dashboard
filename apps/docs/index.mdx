description: "Runtime reliability for AI agents in production. Detect drift, verify outputs, and auto-correct failures — before your customers notice."
---

Your AI agent doesn't crash. It **drifts**.

Model updates change behavior. Prompts degrade over time. Tool calls return unexpected data. Your agent still runs — it just stops being _right_.

**Vex** is the open-source runtime reliability layer that catches this. It sits between your agent and your users, continuously verifying that outputs meet your quality bar.

<Card title="Drift Detection" icon="radar">
  Continuously monitors agent behavior for silent changes in output quality,
  consistency, and task adherence.
</Card>

<Card title="Execution Tracing" icon="route">
  Records every step of your agent's execution — tool calls, LLM responses,
  intermediate reasoning — for full observability.
</Card>

<Card title="Sync Verification" icon="shield-check">
  Inline quality gates that score confidence and take action (pass, flag, block)
  before the response reaches your users.
</Card>

<Card title="Correction Cascade" icon="rotate">
  Three-layer auto-correction: surgical repair → constrained regeneration →
  full re-prompt. Each layer progressively more aggressive.

## Why not just use evals or tracing?

| | Evals | Tracing | **Vex** |
|---|---|---|---|
| **When** | Before deploy | After deploy | **During execution** |
| **Catches** | Known failure modes | Performance issues | **Behavioral drift** |
| **Action** | Manual iteration | Manual investigation | **Automatic correction** |
| **Latency** | Offline | Passive | **< 200ms (sync)** |
